                    Greens on Screen’s first page was published in January 1999. Its early purpose was to bring 
                    Plymouth Argyle a little closer to those unable to see their team, and whilst it has changed 
                    a great deal over the years, its core themes - sites and sounds for Westcountry exiles - still 
                    stand. The site was very lucky to take on the content of Trevor Scallan’s Semper Viridis in the 
                    summer of 2007, and in 2009 launched GoS-DB, a wealth of facts and figures from PAFC’s history. 
                    A year later we embarked on a complete history of Argyle, with much-valued contributions from 
                    chapter authors.

                    Greens on Screen is an amateur website and proud of it. It is run by one person as a hobby, 
                    although there have been aspects of the site over the years that would be much the poorer 
                    without the had work and much-valued contributions of a small band of volunteers.

                    Greens on Screen is self-taught and as a result, a little bit quirky. Amongst a few stubborn 
                    principles, advertisements will never appear (and don’t get me started on the plague of betting 
                    promotions on other sites). It began its life before many others, including the club’s official 
                    site, when there was a large gap to be filled, and although there is now a wide variety to choose 
                    from, GoS’s sole aim, to be a service to fellow supporters, still seems to have a place.
