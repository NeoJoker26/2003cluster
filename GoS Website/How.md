#How does the code work?
-----
Hello there if you reading this it means  you are doing the front-end for this files

I shall first answer the question for the guy's doing the frot-end

1. How is the front-end going to interat with the back-end?

you problaly want to know how to make your button work with the code in the back-end the answer for this simple question is to make the button redirect to the same page with diferente parameter ex:...gosdb-misc6?comp=league&points=mp&length=28&venue=HA
(the back end code contains switch stament displaying the diferente options)

the Gosdb-misc6 page cotains a example of a button working with the backend to display a difFerente table go check it out when i eventualy uploaded

2.How to I know the correct parameter to change and which option is avaliable?


Request.Query[<nameofparameter>] to check which parameter is going to be readed by the back-end, and to see what option of paramenter work just see the switch statements
  
3. can you  put a comment saying which paramenter option exist and is going to read?
  No, except for misc6 
  
  
  or you can just ask me on dicord I don't bite
  
  
  For more info DM me on disc
