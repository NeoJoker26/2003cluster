# Goal
The goal of the project was to modernize the client's website by migrating it from an older version of ASP/VBScritps to a newer one, while also incorporating HTML5 and ASP.NET 6 code. This was done to meet the client's requirement of having a more professional and up-to-date website.

To get a better idea of what the project entailed, you can watch the prototype video that was created: https://youtu.be/2_KrQ6SZIdA.

This Git repository contains the updated code for the website, which replaces the legacy HTML4 and ASP.NET/VBScripts with modern HTML5 and ASP.NET 6 code.
